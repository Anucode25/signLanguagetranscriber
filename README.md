# Sign Language to Voice Transcriber

## Overview

This project aims to develop a Sign Language to Voice Transcriber using machine learning techniques. The transcriber takes input from a video feed of sign language gestures and translates them into spoken language using a synthesized voice.

## Features

- Real-time sign language recognition
- Translation of sign language gestures into spoken language
- Adjustable sensitivity and accuracy settings
- User-friendly interface

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Anucode25/signLanguagetranscriber.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Download pre-trained models for sign language recognition (if required).

## Usage

1. Run the application:

    ```
    python trial.py
    ```

2. Ensure your webcam is connected and functioning properly.

3. Position your hands in front of the webcam and perform sign language gestures.

4. The application will translate the gestures into spoken language.
   
6. Before  using need to create your databse of sign and the feed the images to teachable machine for creating your model
